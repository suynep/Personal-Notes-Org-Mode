* Interesting Idea: Combination of Flock Simulation (boids) and Music Beats

Whenever a `beat` hits, generative a batch of boids in a circular pattern with a certain radius. The boids follow the pattern of movement as a flock and gradually fade via a `transparency` variable.

First, generate a boid algo, then work on the rest of the problem.
