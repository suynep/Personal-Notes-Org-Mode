* Chapter 1

** The Interpreter we'll be crafting
We will be making a new programming language called ~Lox~. Lox will be implemented in the Java Programming Language and shall be named as ~jLox~.

* Chapter 2
** Starting Quote:
/"You must have a map, no matter how rough, otherwise you'll end up wandering all over the place."/
** Objectives:
+ Implement a Language
+ Understand parts of a language

** High level overview of the Mountain we shall be climbing

** Topic: Scanning
Scanning, also called ~Lexing~, or ~Lexical analysis~, is the process of having the *scanner* (/lexer/) to take in a linear stream of characters and transpile them into something akin to a word.
+ Each word is called a /Token/.

Example of Tokenization:

** Topic: Parsing
Parsing is the step where our syntax gets the *grammar* -- the ability to compose larger expressions out of smaller parts.

A parser takes in the tokens generated from scanning and generates an *Abstract Syntax Tree* -- that essentially reflects the nested nature of the language's grammar.
